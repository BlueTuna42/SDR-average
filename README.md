# Basic info
This project is mainly dedicated for radio astronomy as it allows to average large amounts of SDR data to reduce noise, remove background and also fit spectrum with gaussian curves. By fitting gaussians you can model how a number of different radio sources resulted in this spectrum. 
It reads IQ data from .wav files, averages and saves spectrum in txt file, and plot average and median filtered spectrum.
You can edit parameters at the header of .py files.
